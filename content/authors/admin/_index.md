During my studies,l gradually become interested in Machine Learning, Data analysis and Computer Vision. After being advised by Prof.Chunjie Cao, l start being enthusiastic about learning **Adversarial Example**.

I hope to get an internship opportunity to prove my worth in practice. Of course, money is also crucial. If the conditions permit, I hope to continue studying for a Ph.D.
